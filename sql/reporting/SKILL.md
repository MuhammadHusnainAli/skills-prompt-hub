# SQL Reporting

Build business reports, dashboards queries, KPI calculations, and scheduled report generation with SQL.

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this skill when the user:
- Needs business reports or dashboard queries
- Asks for KPI or metric calculations
- Wants periodic reports (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Needs executive summaries or scorecards
- Asks for comparison reports (YoY, MoM)
- Wants formatted output for presentations

## Report Types

### 1. Summary Reports

High-level aggregations for executive dashboards.

### 2. Detail Reports

Transaction-level data with filtering and sorting.

### 3. Trend Reports

Time-series analysis showing changes over periods.

### 4. Comparison Reports

Side-by-side comparisons (period over period, entity vs entity).

### 5. Exception Reports

Highlight anomalies or items requiring attention.

### 6. Operational Reports

Day-to-day business operations tracking.

## Report Building Workflow

```
1. REQUIREMENTS  -> Understand what metrics/data needed
2. SCOPE         -> Define date ranges, filters, dimensions
3. METRICS       -> Calculate KPIs and aggregations
4. FORMAT        -> Structure output for readability
5. OPTIMIZE      -> Ensure performance for scheduled runs
6. VALIDATE      -> Verify numbers against source
```

## Common KPI Calculations

### Revenue Metrics

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
    
    COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS total_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers,
    
    SUM(total) AS gross_revenue,
    SUM(total) - SUM(discount) AS net_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'refunded' THEN total ELSE 0 END) AS refunds,
    SUM(total) - SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'refunded' THEN total ELSE 0 END) AS adjusted_revenue,
    
    ROUND(AVG(total), 2) AS average_order_value,
    ROUND(SUM(total) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 2) AS revenue_per_customer,
    
    SUM(total) - LAG(SUM(total)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)) AS revenue_change,
    ROUND(100.0 * (SUM(total) - LAG(SUM(total)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date))) / 
        NULLIF(LAG(SUM(total)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)), 0), 2) AS revenue_growth_pct

FROM orders
WHERE status NOT IN ('cancelled')
  AND order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '1 year'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

### Customer Metrics

```sql

    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', c.created_at) AS cohort_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) AS new_customers,

        SUM(o.total) AS revenue_from_new
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id 
        AND o.order_date BETWEEN c.created_at AND c.created_at + INTERVAL '30 days'
    WHERE c.created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE)
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', c.created_at)
)

    cohort_month,
    new_customers,
    converted_customers,
    ROUND(100.0 * converted_customers / NULLIF(new_customers, 0), 2) AS conversion_rate,
    ROUND(revenue_from_new / NULLIF(converted_customers, 0), 2) AS avg_first_order_value,
    SUM(new_customers) OVER (ORDER BY cohort_month) AS cumulative_customers
FROM customer_metrics
ORDER BY cohort_month;
```

### Product Metrics

```sql
SELECT 
    p.category,
    p.name AS product,
    
    COUNT(DISTINCT oi.order_id) AS orders,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS units_sold,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS revenue,
    
    ROUND(AVG(oi.unit_price), 2) AS avg_selling_price,
    ROUND(SUM(oi.quantity * (oi.unit_price - p.cost)) / NULLIF(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price), 0) * 100, 2) AS margin_pct,
    
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) / 
        SUM(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price)) OVER (), 2) AS pct_of_total_revenue,
    
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) DESC) AS revenue_rank,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.category ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity) DESC) AS category_rank

FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  AND o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY p.category, p.id, p.name, p.cost
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

## Comparison Reports

### Year-over-Year Comparison

```sql

        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
        COUNT(*) AS orders,
        SUM(total) AS revenue,

      AND status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
),

    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
        COUNT(*) AS orders,
        SUM(total) AS revenue,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '1 year'

    ROUND(c.revenue, 2) AS current_revenue,
    ROUND(p.revenue, 2) AS prior_revenue,
    ROUND(c.revenue - p.revenue, 2) AS revenue_change,

FROM current_period c
LEFT JOIN prior_period p ON c.month = p.month
ORDER BY c.month;
```

### Regional Comparison

```sql
WITH regional_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        r.name AS region,
        COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) AS orders,
        COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) AS customers,
        SUM(o.total) AS revenue,
        AVG(o.total) AS avg_order_value
    FROM orders o
    JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
    JOIN regions r ON c.region_id = r.id
    WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('quarter', CURRENT_DATE)
      AND o.status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY r.name
)
SELECT 
    region,

        WHEN revenue > AVG(revenue) OVER () * 1.2 THEN 'Above Average'
        WHEN revenue < AVG(revenue) OVER () * 0.8 THEN 'Below Average'
        ELSE 'Average'
    END AS performance

FROM regional_metrics
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

## Formatting Best Practices

### Currency Formatting

```sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(revenue, 'FM$999,999,999.00') AS revenue_formatted,
    TO_CHAR(growth_rate, 'FM990.0%') AS growth_formatted
FROM metrics;
```

### Date Formatting

```sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(date, 'Mon DD, YYYY') AS date_formatted,
    TO_CHAR(date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month_formatted,
    TO_CHAR(date, 'Day') AS day_of_week
FROM data;
```

### Conditional Formatting Hints

```sql
SELECT 
    metric,
    value,
    CASE 
        WHEN value > 0 THEN 'positive'
        WHEN value < 0 THEN 'negative'
        ELSE 'neutral'
    END AS style_class,
    CASE 
        WHEN value > threshold * 1.1 THEN 'green'
        WHEN value < threshold * 0.9 THEN 'red'
        ELSE 'yellow'
    END AS status_color
FROM metrics;
```

## Output Format

When creating reports:

1. **Purpose**: What question does this report answer
2. **Query**: Optimized SQL with formatting
3. **Metrics Explained**: Definition of each calculated field
4. **Filters**: Date range and other parameters
5. **Usage Notes**: How to interpret or modify
